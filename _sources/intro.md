# BioImage Analysis with Python #EMBOLSM 2025

This page contains training materials for the BioImage Analysis hands-on tutorial at the [EMBO Practical Course Light Sheet Microscopy 2025](https://meetings.embo.org/event/25-lsm).

## Target audience

The notebooks are written for life scientists with basic experience in Python programming. As we have only 2 hours during the hands-on tutorial, it is recommended that everyone picks some exercises according to their skill-level and needs.

## How to use these materials

On the top of the window, you find a Github-Button, which you can use to navigate the repository of the training materials.

Download the entire repository as ZIP and unzip the files in a place where you can find them. E.g. on your Desktop.

After the ZIP has been unpacked, navigate to the `docs` folder of the repository using the terminal. E.g. if you downloaded and unpacked the ZIP file on your Desktop, you can do this like this:

```
cd Desktop
```
or (if you use OneDrive to sync your Desktop)
```
cd OneDrive/Desktop
```

```
cd embo-lsm-bia-2025-main
```
```
cd docs
```
After arriving in this folder, activate your conda environment (if not installed yet, check the [installation instructions](00_setup/readme.md)):
```
conda activate embo25
```
```
jupyter lab
```

After executing this, you can start Jupyter Lab. On the left side you find folders with exercise notebooks and on the right side you find the notebooks to work on.
