# BioImage Analysis with Python #EMBOLSM 2025

This page contains training materials for the BioImage Analysis hands-on tutorial at the [EMBO Practical Course Light Sheet Microscopy 2025](https://meetings.embo.org/event/25-lsm).

## Target audience

The notebooks are written for life scientists with basic experience in Python programming. As we have only 2 hours during the hands-on tutorial, it is recommended that everyone picks some exercises according to their skill-level and needs.

## Covered topics

* Getting started with Jupyter notebooks
* Image processing and visualization in Jupyter
* Using Napari for image processing with and without coding
* Using artificial intelligence to generate image-analysis Python code
